# Fox game

## TL;DR:

Made a game in which you are a fox that wants to get to a chicken. Beware the farmer. Tap to move.

## About me

Hello Flutter judges and crew!
Before we get started with the app, I'd like to present myself a little more.
My name is Sven Knockaert, and I'm a student IT, last year, based in the idyllic city of Bruges, Belgium.
I'm currently doing an internship with a firm that adopted Flutter recently. My task there is to get to know it better and help write an app for a client that delivers transport services for employees of multiple large companies in the Ghent harbor area. So naturally this contest is a nice opportunity for me to get to know Flutter even better.

## The concept

My entry for the Flutter contest is a game. I chose this aspect of Flutter because I've made a few games in Javascript before. I also chose it because it's a nice change from the Material apps I write during the day :) .
The concept: you are a fox. You want to get to the chicken. Try not to get caught by the angry farmer (he's the owner of the chicken). There is only one control: tap and hold to move forward. Release to stop.

## Technicalities

I've ran the app only on Android smartphones (namely Oneplus 5T and a Huawei). They might work on iOS, but I have no idea. So, I'd recommend it to be ran on an Android device! There are no restrictions otherwise.

A few points I'd like to make: I...
* used the `Flame` package that can be found on pub.dartlang.org because, in my opinion, it's the best package to make Flutter games out there
* used the Visual Studio code auto formatting key combo to guarantee readability
* tried to keep variable names readable too

A few interesting features of Dart and Flutter that I managed to use here: the...
* chaining of method calls with ..
* avoidance of the `new` keyword to save precious bytes
* usage of ? and ?? operators to check for null values
* avoided variable types in function parameters to also save bytes
* usage of the var keyword (just like in Javascript), to prevent having to write longer types (String, List<int>, etc)

Finally, I want to emphasize that all the assets used are handcrafted by myself, in Illustrator and Photoshop. Most of them are made with the pen tool and a Wacom Intuous (source files can be asked for if desired).

I hope you will enjoy my entry.

Kind regards
