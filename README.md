# Fox game

Hello Flutter judges and crew!
My entry for the Flutter contest is a game. It's a .. fox.. get to the chicken .. farmer

I want to emphasize that all the assets found are handcrafted myself, in Illustrator and Photoshop. Most of them are made with the pen tool and my Wacom Intuous.

A few points I'd like to make: I...
• used the Flame library that can be found on pub.dartlang.com because, in my opinion, it's the best package to make Flutter games out there
• avoided the usage of the new keyword
• used var instead of variable specific declarations
• used auto formatting to guarantee readability
• tried to keep variable names readable
• avoided variable type in function parameters

A few interesting features Dart and Flutter that I managed to use here:
• the chaining of method calls with ..
• the usage of ? and ?? operators to check for null values
• the var keyword, just like in Javascript


// remove git

// explain myself:
// I used flame because I think it's a fair use case
